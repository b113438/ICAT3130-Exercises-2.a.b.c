***This application allows the user to take a picture when pressing the button "CAMERA".***

---

It is supposed that the button starts being inactive, but once the permissions of the device's camera are accepted, it will change directly to active mode.

The user will be able to take plenty of pictures, but they will not be saved in the corresponding device.
